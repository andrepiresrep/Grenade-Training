# Grenade-Training

A sourcemod plugin for Counter-Strike:Source that allows players to use noclip and get all grenades (hegrenade, flashbang and smokegrenade).

This is used so that players can practice throwing grenades, flashes and smokes.


Players simply create a bind on the console for using noclip like so:

bind i sm_toggle_noclip


And for getting grenades players create a bind on console like so:

bind o sm_give_nades

Note: Does not require sv_cheats enabled.

Simply add the grenade_training.smx file to the addons/sourcemod/plugins/ folder of the server to install the plugin.

Requires sourcemod and metamod already installed on the server.
